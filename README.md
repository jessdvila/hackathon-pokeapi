Chrome Extension Hackathon

ideas:
using a pokemon API to replace images of instructors on codesmith website
-start with codesmith for testing,
-later consider expanding to work with other websites

to do
- [ ] use a gitHub repo to share code
- [ ] create js file 
- [ ] json file to communicate with google page to run js
- [ ] jQuery file to access 

goals
- [ ] have fun! 
- [ ] replace instructors faces with pokemon
- [ ] track how many pokemon are “caught”
        - [ ] Manipulate header to track score
        - [ ] maybe track how many unique pokemon caught
- [ ] have a popup when x amount of pokemon are caught


stretch goals
- [ ] turn on the extension and it changes the page background into something to show “game mode”
- [ ] show the counter somewhere — manipulate the header
